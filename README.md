# CPP
A repository I created for solving some C++ tasks and problems.

About The Compiler:

g++ 8.1.0 , __cplusplus 201402L

About The Source Code:

derived_Task1.cpp finds and prints the maximum number in a given array.

derived_Task2.cpp reads an int input from the user and searches about it in a pre-defined array.
